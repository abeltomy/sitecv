On July 1, 2025, while spending the summer in Tokyo, I set out on a "walk" : visiting the [Tokyo Toilet project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tokyo_Toilet) sites across the city. Inspired by the film [Perfect Days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_Days), I left my hotel room at 8 a.m. and began my journey on foot.This is simply a documentation of the photos I took along the way.<br>
